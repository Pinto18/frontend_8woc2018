The goal of this doument should be to explain how to setup the environment required to run your project with as many steps as 
necessary 
so that anyone could read your document and get your submission running on their computer with as few assumptions as
possible. An example
for this front end can be seen below:



1) My Environment:
 
    Surface Pro Running Windows 10
    


2) Installations:

    1. Node.JS:

       a. Follow this link, https://nodejs.org/en/download/, then click on installer that matches your OS and save the 
          executable to your
 downloads folder. Then, open File Explorer, navigate to your Downloads folder, and double click 
          on the file you just
 saved. Follow the installation instructions from there.
    


3) Run the project:
    
    1. Open up your command prompt

    2. Change your directory to the folder containing the Git Repository for this project.

    3. Type in the command "npm install" (Only need to do this once)

    4. Type in the command "npm start"

       - From this point your default browser should open up and navigate automatically to http://localhost:9000, where the project is running
